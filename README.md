# SDLE

## Description
Development of a command line local-first shopping list application. This application allows users to create/edit shopping lists and share them through a cloud componet. The local-first approach allows users to edit their shopping list in offline mode. The cloud componet was designed using the concept of consistent hashing allowing the addition and removal of nodes/servers for high availability and scalability. This architecture was inspired by the [Amazon DynamoDB paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf). To ensure seamless collaboration, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) were implemented.
